# MTG Deck Diff

A single-page web app to compare two Magic: The Gathering decks.

Paste or load two deck `.txt` files, and it will:
- Sort cards by name.
- Fetch card thumbnails and stats from Scryfall.
- Show color-coded differences:
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red â€” only in Deck A
  - ðŸŸ© Green â€” only in Deck B
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â€” different quantities
  - âš« Gray â€” same in both decks
